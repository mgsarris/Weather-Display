# Weather-Display

This project involves the use of openweathermap's weather api in order to display the current weather conditions of the users city (which should be setup in main.py). It utilizes pySerial in order to push the information recieved from openweathermap's api to the atmega328p microcontroller in order to drive the display over i2c (TWI).
